Smart Investment Tracker  

Overview  
Smart Investment Tracker is a unified financial management app that allows users to track, compare, and invest in mutual funds (MFs) and stocks from multiple platforms—all in one place. With AI-driven insights, a user-friendly interface, and one-click execution, this app simplifies investment decisions for both beginners and experienced investors.  

Key Features  
1️⃣ Automatic Portfolio Tracking  
- Fetches data from *MF Central API, broker APIs*  
- Displays *all investments* with execution links (e.g., "Buy more" button for funds).  
- Just like *PhonePe for bank balances*, but for stocks & mutual funds.  

2️⃣ Smart AI-Powered Comparison Tool  
- Uses *AI/ML* to recommend *better performing* funds & stocks.  
- Simple visual indicators like:  
  - *Trust Score* (⭐ ratings like Uber drivers)  
  - *Risk Meter* (🟢 Low | 🟠 Medium | 🔴 High)  
  - *Projected Returns* ("₹10,000 → ₹12,000 in 1 year" 📈)  
- Example: “Fund A is better than Fund B: 15% returns, same risk. Switch now? ✅”  

3️⃣ One Dashboard for Tracking + Execution  
- See all *MFs + stocks* in a *single interactive dashboard*.  
- One-click execution: "Invest Now" button (like Amazon’s *"Buy Now"*).  
- No need to log in separately to MF Central or broker platforms.  

4️⃣ Super Simple & Interactive UI   
- Uses *icons & plain-English summaries* for easy understanding.  
- *One-click actions*:  
  - Compare funds (like Amazon product comparison)  
  - Quick Invest (like Uber’s "Book Ride")  


Real-Life Example  
Imagine your father uses this app to:  
1. *See all investments: *"Zerodha: ₹50K in stocks | MF Central: ₹1L in MFs."  
2. *Compare Funds: AI suggests switching to a **higher-return* fund.  
3. *Execute Instantly: Click *"Invest Now" to buy Fund B *without logging in elsewhere*.  

Tech Stack  
- *Frontend*: React.js  
- *Backend*: Node.js 
- *Database*: Firestore Database 
- *APIs*: MFU API, Broker APIs 
- *AI/ML*: Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
